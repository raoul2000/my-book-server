# TODO
- attribute is_traveling should be returned as boolean in REST response
- In book-ping/form, booking number parsing should be case insensitive and ignore missing '-' character
- **fix**: user should be able to ping more than one book. Today, the session does not inclide ticketId so when the isSaved variable session is TRUE, ping is not possible anymore for this ticketId *but also for any other ticketId*


## Book Travel Management
- how to handle the fact that the travel of a book is suspended while being read ?. One option is 'steps' : the travel is a list of steps. Or maybe
just don't manage this part ! What if the person who found and read the travaling book is a user and wants to add this book to his/her book list ?


## Book Ticket
- add table `book_ticket`
- add FK to `book` : one book MAY have at most one ticket

Rule:
- a book traveling CANNOT be in read status "READING"
- a book travaling CANNOT change its reading status
- a book traveling CANNOT be modified : title, subtitle, author, isbn, etc ....

# DONE
## `book` primary key
- col `id` should be created as being the primaryKey

## Refactor book ping/review
- delete table `book_ping`
- rename `book_review` to `book_ping`
- add col `updated_at` to `book_p√Æng`
- when client pings a book, create a new entry in `book_ping` with only col `user_ip` set. Then return ID of this new entry
- when user submit the ping form, update the entry if needed (using the returned ID)
